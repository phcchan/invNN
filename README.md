# Projects

## Option pricing using Monte Carlo and generative neural net model

[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/phcchan/invNN/blob/master/option_MC_invNN.ipynb)

Use the learned distribution of log returns by generative model (normalizing flow) to estimate the
option price via Monte Carlo

*Techniques*: Monte Carlo option pricing, generative neural model
